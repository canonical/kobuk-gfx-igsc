Description: Intel(R) Graphics System Controller Firmware Update Library
 Intel(R) Graphics System Controller Firmware Update Library (IGSC FU)
 The API is divided into 3 groups:
  1. Device FW API: This API provides wrapper for accessing the GSC Firmware 
   API. The API requires device access. This API includes actual image update
   functionality.
  2. Image API: Provides API for retrieving the required information from the
   update images and utilizes library image parsing capabilities.
  3. Device API: API utilizing underlying operating system in order to enumerate
   and access graphics device and retrieve information.
 Orthogonally the API provides facility to update GSC Firmware and the OPROM 
 image.
